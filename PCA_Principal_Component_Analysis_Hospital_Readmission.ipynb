As medians are less likely to be influenced by outliers, medians were used in the imputation of the missing values of Age and Income (Poulson, 2016). Since the distribution of Hospital Days was bimodal, a mode was used for imputation. \n",

This resulted in a transformation from a uniform distribution to a normal distribution. Imputation was tried with mean, but generated the same result, a normal distribution. The limitations of being unable to access the original data source, and the patient's actual respective ages is producing a limitation on the data analysis that could have been cured with access to the original data source.
